# fish-tank
Fish tank for creating your fishes locally or remotely

This something I cooked up to learn about creating a docker and using web-services

It's supposed to be show in a screen and using another device we can create fishes or just click to create a random fish anywhere :)

To run:

>docker build --tag fish-tank .

>docker run fish-tank
