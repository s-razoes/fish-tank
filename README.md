# fish-tank
Fish tank for creating your fishes locally or remotely

This something I cooked up to learn about creating a docker and using web-services

It's supposed to be show in a screen and using another device we can create fishes or just click to create a random fish anywhere :)

To run:

>docker build --tag fish-tank .

>docker run fish-tank

Main screen:
![Screenshot fish tank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-razoes/fish-tank/main/screen1.png)
Press anywhere on the screen to add a random size and color fish.

Control screen, usually for a phone
![Screenshot control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-razoes/fish-tank/main/screen2.png)
Click the fish to add it to the main screen with a random position.
